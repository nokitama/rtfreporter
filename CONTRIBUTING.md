# Contributing to rtfreporter

Thanks for taking the time to contribute! Issues and pull requests are
very welcome at <https://github.com/ichirio/rtfreporter>.

By participating in this project you agree to abide by its
[Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Reporting bugs

Open an issue at
<https://github.com/ichirio/rtfreporter/issues> and include:

- A short description of what you expected vs. what happened.
- A **minimal reproducible example** (a `reprex::reprex()` is ideal):
  the smallest self-contained snippet that triggers the problem.
- The output of `sessionInfo()` (R version, OS, package versions).
- For rendering problems, the offending `.rtf` (or the code that
  produces it) and, where possible, a screenshot of how it opens in
  Word / LibreOffice.

Please search existing issues first to avoid duplicates.

## Requesting features

Feature requests are welcome as issues. Clinical TFL use cases are the
primary focus, so describing the real-world table/listing/figure you are
trying to produce helps a lot.

## Pull requests

1. **Discuss first** for anything non-trivial — open an issue so we agree
   on the approach before you invest time.
2. Fork the repository and create a topic branch off `main`.
3. Follow the existing code style (see below).
4. Add or update **tests** under `tests/testthat/` for any behaviour
   change, and **documentation** (roxygen2 comments) for any exported
   function.
5. Make sure the checks pass locally:

   ```r
   devtools::document()      # regenerate man/*.Rd (NAMESPACE is hand-managed)
   devtools::test()          # all tests must pass
   devtools::check()         # 0 errors / 0 warnings
   ```

6. Update `NEWS.md` (user-facing) and, for a major/minor change,
   `CHANGELOG.md`.
7. Open the pull request against `main` with a clear description and a
   reference to the related issue (e.g. `Closes #12`).

## Code style

- **S3 throughout**; the package has zero hard runtime dependencies
  (only `methods`, which ships with R). Optional integrations (gt,
  gtsummary, rtables/tern, ...) live in `Suggests` and must be guarded
  with `requireNamespace(...)`.
- twips are the only internal length unit.
- Keep R source ASCII-only (use `\uXXXX` escapes); non-ASCII is fine in
  comments and roxygen but not in code.
- Two-space indentation, `<-` for assignment, and `snake_case` for
  public functions; internal helpers are prefixed with a dot
  (`.helper_name`).
- See
  [`AGENTS.md`](https://github.com/ichirio/rtfreporter/blob/main/AGENTS.md)
  for the repository layout and the internal architecture, and
  [`LEARNING.md`](https://github.com/ichirio/rtfreporter/blob/main/LEARNING.md)
  for the design rationale.

## Development setup

```r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_dev_deps()   # installs Suggests used by tests/vignettes
devtools::load_all()           # load the package for interactive work
```
